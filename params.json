However, whenever possible, the extra credits were implemented.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots below show some of the functionalities implemented:\r\n- Use of Sections in the Top Places table view: The places are sorted by countries and then by cities\r\n- Thumbnails and accessors in the map annotations\r\n- thumbnails for each photo in the table view\r\n- iPhone and iPad screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
